# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Press Win + S, type "PowerShell," then right-click on "Windows PowerShell" and select Run as Administrator. Set Execution Policy for Current Session Temporarily bypass the restriction by running this command: [Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass]

Run Your Command Again: After setting the policy, run: [npm run start]

Resolve Build/Runtime Errors If the error persists: Run npm install to ensure all dependencies are installed. Restart the development server [npm run dev]
